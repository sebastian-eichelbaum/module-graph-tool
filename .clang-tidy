# Disable some very company/target-specific checks.
#
#  -cert-dcl59-cpp: Google specific to disallow anonymous namespaces. Anonymous namespaces have several advantages for
#                   visibility control though.
#  -misc-non-private-member-variables-in-classes: this complains about public members in classes, but also
#                                                 structs where they are useful and intended
#
#  -modernize-use-trailing-return-type: this forces the use of trailing return types everywhere. This is not very
#                                       useful.
#
#  -readability-magic-numbers: already covered by cppcoreguidelines-avoid-magic-numbers
#
#  -bugprone-easily-swappable-parameters: Complains if a function takes multiple, similarly types parameters. It
#                                         complains that they can be swapped by accident. True, but often unavaidable.
#
#  -readability-identifier-length: complains about too short identifiers. Very annoying for for-loop variables and
#                                  alike.
